This solution offers a Docker configuration for Apache Jena Fuseki, a SPARQL 1.1 server with a web interface, utilizing the Apache Jena TDB RDF triple store. It streamlines the deployment and management of a Fuseki server in development or production environments. Prerequisites include Docker, Docker Compose, and the `make` utility. The project structure comprises a `Dockerfile` for the Docker image, a `Makefile` for management commands, and scripts for data loading and querying. This setup has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.
