# Apache Jena Fuseki Docker Setup

This project provides a Dockerized environment for Apache Jena Fuseki, a SPARQL 1.1 server with a web interface, backed by the Apache Jena TDB RDF triple store.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
- `make` utility installed. On Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install make
   ```

- This setup has been tested on **Ubuntu 22.04**. It may work on other operating systems, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for Apache Jena Fuseki.
- `Makefile`: Contains commands to build, run, load data, query, and manage the Docker container.
- `data/paul-family.ttl`: Sample Turtle (TTL) file containing RDF data.
- `query.rq`: SPARQL query file to interact with the dataset.
- `config-tdb2.ttl`: Configuration file for setting up a TDB2-backed dataset in Fuseki.

## First Run

To quickly set up and test Apache Jena Fuseki with a TDB2-backed dataset, execute the following commands:

```bash
make build      # Build the Docker image
make run-tdb2   # Start Fuseki with a TDB2 dataset
make load       # Load sample RDF data into the dataset
make query      # Execute a SPARQL query and display the results
```

Once these commands are completed, you can access:

- The Fuseki Admin Interface: [http://localhost:3030/](http://localhost:3030/)
- SPARQL Query Results: Displayed directly in the terminal.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

   This command builds the Docker image for Apache Jena Fuseki using the provided `Dockerfile`.

2. **Run Fuseki with an In-Memory Dataset:**

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

   Starts the Fuseki server with an in-memory dataset accessible at [http://localhost:3030/](http://localhost:3030/).

3. **Run Fuseki with a TDB2 Dataset:**

   ```bash
   make run-tdb2
   ```

   Starts the Fuseki server with a TDB2-backed dataset using the configuration specified in `config-tdb2.ttl`.

4. **Load Data into Fuseki:**

   ```bash
   make load
   ```

   Loads RDF data from `data/paul-family.ttl` into the dataset. Ensure the server is running before executing this command.

5. **Execute a SPARQL Query:**

   ```bash
   make query
   ```

   Sends the SPARQL query defined in `query.rq` to the Fuseki server and displays the results.

6. **Stop the Running Fuseki Container:**

   ```bash
   make stop
   ```

   Stops the Fuseki Docker container if it's running.

7. **Clean Up Docker Resources:**

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

   Stops the running container and removes the Docker image to free up system resources.

8. **Display Available Makefile Targets:**

   ```bash
   make help
   ```

   Displays a list of available `Makefile` targets along with their descriptions, facilitating easier navigation and usage of the `Makefile`.

## Configuration

- **`config-tdb2.ttl`:** This file configures the TDB2 dataset for Fuseki. Ensure it's correctly set up to define your dataset and endpoints.

- **`query.rq`:** Contains the SPARQL query to be executed against the dataset. Modify this file to change the query as needed.

## Notes

- **Data Persistence:** When using a TDB2-backed dataset, consider mounting a Docker volume to `/fuseki/databases` to persist data across container restarts.

- **Port Configuration:** The default port is `3030`. If this port is in use or you prefer a different port, modify the `-p` flag in the `Makefile` accordingly.

- **Admin Interface:** Access the Fuseki admin interface at [http://localhost:3030/](http://localhost:3030/).
